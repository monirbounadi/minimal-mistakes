### Genealogy

My paternal lineage originates from Rabat, Morocco, while my maternal lineage traces its roots back to Stockholm, Sweden. I have a genealogical record of three generations on my paternal side and approximately sixteen generations on my maternal side. I intend to share my detailed family tree in the future.
