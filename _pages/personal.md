# Genealogical Research

My father was born in Rabat, Morocco. My mother was born in Stockholm, Sweden. I grew up with both. I can trace my paternal ancestry 3 generations back and my maternal ancestry about 16 generations back. I have done an autosomal DNA test, a Y-DNA test, and a mtDNA test. I know quite a bit about myself, so will post some of what I have learned for other interested genealogists.

# Movies

I am a cineast.

# Music

I enjoy music, and here is an old playlist I created when Spotify was new.
