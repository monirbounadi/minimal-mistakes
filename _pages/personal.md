### Genealogy

My paternal lineage originates from the cities of Rabat and Fes in Morocco, while my maternal lineage traces its roots back to the city of Stockholm and the parish of Grang√§rde in Sweden. I have a genealogical record of three generations on my paternal side sourced from oral testimonies, and sixteen generations on my maternal side sourced from state and church records. Genetically I belong to the haplogroups [E-M35](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haplogroup_E-M35) and [HV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haplogroup_HV). 

My first name, [Monir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munir), hails from Arabic roots, signifying "illuminating" or "enlightening." As for my surname, its origins are shrouded in a bit more mystery, with written records failing to provide clear insight. However, according to my father, the father of my paternal grandfather bore the surname "Bounaga," a name that aptly described his occupation as a camel herder, translating to "on a camel." Over time, either he or his son, my paternal grandfather, opted to adapt the surname to "Bounadi" to better harmonize with the French language.
