## Professional Bio

I work as a teaching fellow and research assistant. In these roles, I help students and researchers understand and solve statistical problems. I am also a student taking graduate courses in statistics and econometrics.

My research interests unify my interests in ethics and statistics. For example, causal inference to identify effective charitable interventions, and statistics to help policymakers weigh different kinds of evidence.

If I can help you, contact me.
