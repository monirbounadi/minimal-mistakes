## Personal Bio

My full name is Monir Elias Eliasson Bounadi. My first name and last name are from my father who immigrated from Morocco to Sweden during the 1980s. My middle names are from my Swedish-born mother.

I grew up in Hammarbyhöjden and Kärrtorp, suburbs south of Södermalm in Stockholm, Sweden. Though I spent most of my time in Stockholm, I spent many summers in Rabat, Morocco. 

Until 18 my big interests were running, manga, film, and gaming. I was quite a well-trained cineast with expert knowledge in Street Fighter back then. Today I try to entertain my past interests whenever I can. But mainly I live for my love of philosophy and try to channel this love by applying statistical methods to solve social science problems.

I am also an effective altruist and spend about 30% of my income (net living expenses) on effective charities. As a strict vegan, I spend some of this on animal charities. I plan to raise my share to 50% by the end of 2019.

## Professional Bio

I work as a teaching fellow and research assistant. In these roles I help students and researchers understand and solve statistical problems. I am also a student taking graduate courses in statistics and econometrics.

My research interests unifies my interests in ethics and statistics. This includes causal inference to identify effective charitable interventions. It also includes theoretical statistics to help policymakers weigh different kinds of evidence.

If I can help you, contact me.
