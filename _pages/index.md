## About Me

Hello. I'm an economist with research interests in development economics, econometrics, and political economy.

I'm currently a student and employee at [Stockholm University](https://www.su.se/english/) where I do Masters and PhD level coursework in theoretical statistics and teach mathematical statistics and econometrics. I also assist Associate Professor [David Seim](http://www.davidseim.com/) and Professor [David Strömberg](http://perseus.iies.su.se/~dstro/) at the Department of Economics. Now and then I tutor former Minister for Finance of Sweden [Anders Borg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anders_Borg). I will start my PhD in Economics at Stockholm University this fall.

I received my MSc in econometrics from Stockholm University in 2018 and degrees in mathematics and philosophy before that.

Here is my [CV][cv].
