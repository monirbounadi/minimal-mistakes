## Bio

I am a PhD candidate at the [Institute for International Economic Studies](https://www.su.se/institute-for-international-economic-studies/) (IIES) at Stockholm University. 

I hold an MSc in Econometrics, an MSc in Mathematics, and a BA in Philosophy, all from Stockholm University. I spent the Michaelmas term of 2024 and the Hilary term of 2025 as a Recognised Student at the Department of Economics at the University of Oxford.

I am an applied microeconomist specializing in historical economics at the intersection of development and political economics.
