I am an amanuensis, seminar teacher, and research assistant at the [Department of Mathematics](https://www.math.su.se/english/) and the [Department of Economics](https://www.ne.su.se/english/) at Stockholm University. 

Currently, I study theoretical statistics at the graduate level (MSc, PhD) at Stockholm University. 

If I can help you, contact me.
