I am a student at [Stockholm University](https://www.su.se/english/) taking graduate (MSc, PhD) courses in theoretical statistics. I am also an amanuensis at the [Department of Mathematics at Stockholm University](https://www.math.su.se/english/) and a teaching assistant at the [Department of Economics at Stockholm University](https://www.ne.su.se/english/). In addition, I am a research assistant for Associate Professor [David Seim](http://www.davidseim.com/) and Professor [David Str√∂mberg](http://perseus.iies.su.se/~dstro/) at the Department of Economics at Stockholm University. Lastly, I do PhD tutoring to [former Minister for Finance of Sweden Anders Borg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anders_Borg).
