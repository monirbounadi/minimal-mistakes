Hello. I am an economist with research interests in development economics, econometrics, and political economy.

I am currently a student at [Stockholm University](https://www.su.se/english/) doing Masters and PhD level coursework in theoretical statistics. I also teach mathematical statistics and econometrics at the Departments of Mathematics and Economics at Stockholm University and to former Minister for Finance of Sweden [Anders Borg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anders_Borg). In addition I asssist Associate Professor [David Seim](http://www.davidseim.com/) and Professor [David Strömberg](http://perseus.iies.su.se/~dstro/) with their research at the Department of Economics at Stockholm University.

I received my MSc in econometrics from Stockholm University in 2018. In 2015 and 2016 I obtained my undergraduate degrees in mathematics and my MSc in mathematics.

Here is my [CV][cv].
