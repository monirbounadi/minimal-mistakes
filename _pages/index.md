# Welcome!

I am an amanuensis, seminar teacher, and research assistant at the [Department of Mathematics](https://www.math.su.se/english/) and the [Department of Economics](https://www.ne.su.se/english/) at Stockholm University. 

Currently I study theoretical statistics (MSc, PhD) at the graduate level at Stockholm University.
