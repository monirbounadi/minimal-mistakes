I am a student at SU taking graduate (MSc, PhD) courses in theoretical statistics. I am an amanuensis at the Department of Mathematics at SU and a teaching assistant at the Department of Economics at SU. I tutor former Minister for Finance of Sweden Anders Borg. I assist David Seim at the Department of Economics at SU. From February 2019 I assist David Str√∂mberg at the same department. I expect to continue in these positions until the end of June 2019. 

For more about me, see my [vitae](https://monirbounadi.github.io/monirbounadi/vitae/), [research](https://monirbounadi.github.io/monirbounadi/research/) and history of [teaching](https://monirbounadi.github.io/monirbounadi/teaching/).
