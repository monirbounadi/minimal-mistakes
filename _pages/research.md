Citizen Science Projects
  : "I demokratins namn – kvinnorna som krävde rösträtt" (in Swedish) ["In the Name of Democracy – The Women Who Demanded the Right to Vote"] (with [Mattias Folkestad][mattias_folkestad_website] and the [National Archives of Sweden][national_archives_of_sweden]). In September 1921, Sweden held its first parliamentary election where both women and men had the right to vote. The decision followed a long political struggle led by the National Association for Women's Suffrage, which collected over 351,000 signatures in 1913–1914, representing around 18 percent of adult women in Sweden. In this project we collaborate with hundreds of citizen now in transcribing the petition to make it searchable and usable for research in political history and science.
