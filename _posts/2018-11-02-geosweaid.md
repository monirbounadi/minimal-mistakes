This Shiny app lets you study the spatial distribution of Swedish aid activities and disbursements at the country-level by year. Note that a year corresponds to an end year. For example, 2017 covers the set of aid activities whose completion dates are in 2017. The definition of an aid activity is a value on iati-identifier from the [IATI standard][IATIStandard]. Disbursements and completion dates are also defined by the IATI standard.
