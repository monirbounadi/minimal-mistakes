This Shiny app shows the spatial distribution of Swedish aid activities and disbursements at the national level by year. To the best of my knowledge, this is the first presentation of this kind. 

The definition of an aid activity is a value on[iati-identifier][iati-identifier] from the IATI standard. Total aid disbursement is in USD and I plan to make an update explaining how it is measured.
